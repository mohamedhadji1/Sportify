3. **Run the Service**

   # Development
   npm run dev
   
   # Production

   ```

## Inter-Service Communication

The Company service communicates with the Auth service to:
- Validate JWT tokens
- Verify user existence and roles
- Ensure only Managers and Admins can own companies

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends request with JWT token
2. Company service validates token with Auth service
3. Auth service returns user information
4. Company service authorizes the request based on user role

## Database Relationships

### Company â†’ User (Owner)
- `ownerId` field references User._id from Auth service
- Only users with role 'Manager' or 'Admin' can own companies
- One user can own multiple companies
- Foreign key constraint enforced at application level

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permissions for Players, Managers, and Admins
- **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own companies (unless Admin)
- **Token Validation**: All protected routes validate JWT tokens with Auth service
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all endpoints

## Error Handling

The service provides consistent error responses:
```javascript
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE", // Optional
  "details": {} // Optional additional details
}
```

## Status Codes
